A workload can be launched by following the below 6 steps.

## 1. **Select the desired Application**.

The application for which the workload has to be run can be selected in this step. It can be done in two ways as mentioned below.

&emsp; a. Navigate to **Applications** page. Select desired application for which workload has to be run.
   
&emsp; **Note**: In this case, we have selected Application as **HPCG**.

&emsp; c. Select desired version if prompted. It can be either docker or singularity.

&emsp; **Note**: In this case, we have selected rocHPCG 3.1.0_97 version and container as **docker**.

## Application Configuration

User can either continue with default script or enter custom commands into the following script fields. 

**Note:** Application configuration step will not be available for applications like pyTorch, tensorflow, Jammy etc.

&emsp; a. **Pre-run Script**

&emsp; &emsp; In this step, commands which are required to be executed before creating containers can be added into **Pre-run Script** field.

&emsp; a. **Run Script**

&emsp; &emsp; In this step, commands which are required to be executed in the container created can be added into **Run Script** field. Benchmarking script for 8 GPUs will be available by default for the selected application in this field. AMD Infinity hub can be referred for more benchmarking commands

&emsp; a. **Post-run Script**

&emsp; &emsp; In this step, commands which are required to be executed after creating containers can be added into **Post-run Script** field.

## Select Resources

Required inputs for workload like number of GPUs, maximum allowed run time, etc can be entered in this step.

&emsp; a. **Queue oversubscribe**

&emsp; b. **Telemetry enabled:**

&emsp; &emsp; If telemetry is enabled, once workload is completed, performance tab will be shown. If disabled, performance tab will not be shown on opening completed/finished workload.

&emsp; c. **Maximun allowed run time**

&emsp; &emsp; The time for which workload is allowed to run should be specified in the max allowed run time field.


 6. Click **Next** to continue with default script.
 
    **Note**: Default script is for 8 GPUs
